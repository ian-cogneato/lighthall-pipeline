# lighthall-pipeline
A working pipeline for parallel processing of neuroimaging data on the UCF parallel computing cluster for https://github.com/lighthall-lab.
Cloned from https://github.com/lucychenrobotics/Nipype-Pipeline-AD-D after her work on the pre-processing steps.

Currently contains a mess of crash files and old drafts, and needs cleanup work in this branch.
Future branches are to bring the repository up to date with the current analysis workflow.
