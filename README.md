# lighthall-pipeline
A working pipeline for parallel processing of neuroimaging data on the UCF parallel computing cluster for github.com/lighthall-lab.
Cloned from https://github.com/lucychenrobotics/Nipype-Pipeline-AD-D after her work on the pre-processing steps.

Currently contains a mess of crash files and old drafts, and needs cleanup work in this branch.

It's not immediately clear to me exactly how any testing was done on the cluster. Future branches are going to address this and bring the repository up to date with the current analysis workflow.
